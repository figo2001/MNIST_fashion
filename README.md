echo "# MNIST Fashion Classification with CNN

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify images from the MNIST Fashion dataset. The MNIST Fashion dataset consists of grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Implement a CNN for image classification on the MNIST Fashion dataset.
- **Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **Programming Language:** Python.
- **Framework:** TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset

The MNIST Fashion dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 different fashion categories:

1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle boot

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-fashion-cnn.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd mnist-fashion-cnn
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook mnist_fashion_classification.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and test the CNN model.

## Results

After training the model, the CNN achieves impressive accuracy on the MNIST Fashion test set. The results are visualized in the notebook, showcasing the model's performance on various fashion items.
