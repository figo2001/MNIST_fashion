### Tasks

1. The MNIST Fashion dataset is a collection of grayscale images depicting 10 different fashion categories, making it a popular benchmark for image classification tasks.

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilized for MNIST Fashion dataset classification, leveraging their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from images.

3. The CNN architecture is designed from scratch, incorporating convolutional layers to extract spatial hierarchies, pooling layers for downsampling, and fully connected layers for classification.

4. Training the CNN involves passing the fashion images through the network, adjusting weights through backpropagation, and optimizing the model to accurately categorize the diverse clothing items.

5. The CNN learns intricate patterns and features crucial for distinguishing between classes, providing a robust framework for image classification tasks.

6. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy are employed to measure the model's performance, showcasing the CNN's capability to achieve high accuracy in classifying fashion items within the MNIST dataset.
